/** \mainpage
 *
 * This is the Video/Image Processing IP library.
 * It includes hardware models in synthesisable SystemC
 * and software models the purpose of which is to define exactly the behaviour of the VIP cores.
 * This definition includes:
 * <ol>
 *  <li> The parameters needed for the VIP cores and the required ranges of these parameters.
 *  <li> The algorithms used in the cores.
 *  <li> A bit-accurate simulation of the cores for the purpose of testing.
 * </ol>
 */

/**
 * \defgroup SWCores Software Core Models
 * These software models form the golden reference specification of the behaviour and parameterisability
 * of the VIP cores. With the exception of the colour space converter (CSC) core, each core works on a single colour plane,
 * so a typical use may be as follows:
 * \dot
 * digraph example {
 * 	rankdir=LR;
 *  source [ label="Image Source" shape="box" ];
 *  m1 [ label="Median" shape="box" ];
 *  m2 [ label="Median" shape="box" ];
 *  m3 [ label="Median" shape="box" ];
 *  sink [ label="Image Sink" shape="box" ];
 *  source -> m1 [ label="Red (5 bit)"];
 *  source -> m2 [ label="Green (6 bit)"];
 *  source -> m3 [ label="Blue (5 bit)"];
 *  m1 -> sink [ label="Red (5 bit)"];
 *  m2 -> sink [ label="Green (6 bit)"];
 *  m3 -> sink [ label="Blue (5 bit)"];
 * }
 * \enddot
 * Each core is modelled by a single software function. The parameters of each core are modelled in three parts:
 * -# Compile time parameters which the user will control using IP Toolbench. These are implemented using
 *    defines. The same defines parameterise the software cores and the hardware cores that they model.
 * -# Datapath connections. Each software model reads and writes data from and to framebuffers in memory.
 *    Pointers to framebuffers are passed as arguments into  the software function. These framebuffer pointers
 *    correspond directly to the ImageStream ports provided to stream pixel data in and out of the hardware
 *    cores. The relationship between framebuffers and ImageStream streams is defined by the FrameToStream (FTS_NAME)
 *    and StreamToFrame (STF_NAME) SystemC models, which read framebuffers and write ImageStream and read ImageStream
 *    and write framebuffers, respectively.
 * -# Control path connections. Extra arguments are passed into each function which correspond to the
 *    control signals on the hardware cores. These are modelled as SystemC types passed by value.
 */

/**
 * \defgroup HWCores Synthesisable SystemC Hardware Cores
 * These hardware models can each be synthesised using CusP to make hardware which will run on Altera FPGAs.
 * The behaviour and parameterisability of each hardware core should be identical to its software
 * model.
 */

/**
 * \defgroup FrameStream Streaming Interface
 * Interfacing between software models and hardware cores.
 * The hardware cores are all designed to work on streams of pixel data. This allows multiple cores to be
 * connected together without the large memory and memory bandwidth requirements of buffering between each
 * core. A standard is required for these streams of pixel data, to define such things as the order in which the
 * pixels in a framebuffer are transmitted.
 *
 * <b>ImageStream v0.1</b>
 *
 * We've given our standard the name ImageStream. The current version is 0.1. This is a very simple standard,
 * we will extend and improve to make more optimisations possible as we work on the performance and features of the
 * cores.
 *
 * ImageStream 0.1 is defined as follows:
 * - A stream of data transferred over "Streaming Avalon" (there is currently work in the UK
 *   on selecting a subclass of Atlantic II to be used for the TI coprocessor boards which should provide performance
 *   benefits and still be SOPC builder compatible, we will move ImageStream over to this when it is ready).
 * - Stream pixels in left-to-right, top to bottom order.
 * - Only one colour plane per stream, three parallel streams to make an RGB or YCbCr image.
 * - Streams are either 8 bits or 10 bits wide, corresponding to 8 or 10 bits per sample image data.
 * - No end-of-line or end-of-packet signalling, blocks know the size of the image data they are expecting.
 *
 * All of the software models are defined to work on framebuffers stored in memory. This helps to make the
 * software models very simple to write and also improves software model execution speed a great deal. To test
 * a hardware block against its executable software specification we therefore need blocks which read framebuffers
 * and write ImageStream and vice versa. These blocks are themselves the golden reference specification for
 * the ImageStream standard.
