--**************************************************************************************
-- FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
-- This file implements prefetch logic
-- Prefetch Register:
-- Prefetch register is required in this kind of design because
-- inputs to the SRAM are registered, hence there will be a delay of one
-- clock to get the valid data for the give address for example
-- if address(1) is provided in clock x. the SRAM will give the data corresponding
-- to address(1) in clock x+1
-- Hence if there is a successful data transfer on the local side we need to provide the
-- next data immediately.
-- If we fetch data directly from SRAM we cannot provide data immediately because of the
-- registered inputs. hence this design performs the following
-- 1. We prefetch the data and increment the SRAM address
-- 2. Provide the Prefetch data as the first data.
-- 3. Switch to SRAM data as soon as prefetch data is transferred

-- Note that this design is assuming that there will be no wait states from target.
-- If the design has to take target waits into consideration
-- The below given logic will be different.
