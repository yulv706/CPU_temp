qq{
There are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who moil for gold,
And the arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold.
The northern lights have seen queer sights,
But the queerest they ever did see
Was the night on the marge of Lake LaBarge
I cremated Sam McGee.

Now, Sam McGee was from Tennessee
Where the cotton blooms and blows.
Why he left his home in the south to roam
Round the pole, God only knows.
He was always cold, but the land of gold
Seemed to hold him like a spell,
Though hed often say, in his homely way,
Hed sooner live in hell.

On a Christmas day we were mushing our way
Over the Dawson Trail.
Talk of your coldthrough the parkas fold
It stabbed like a driven nail.
If our eyes wed close, then the lashes froze
Till sometimes we couldnt see.
It wasnt much fun, but the only one
To whimper was Sam McGee.

And that very night as we lay packed tight
In our robes beneath the snow,
And the dogs were fed, and the stars oerhead
Were dancing heel and toe,
He turned to me, and Cap, says he,
Ill cash in this trip, I guess,
And if I do, Im asking that you
Wont refuse my last request.

Well, he seemed so low I couldnt say no,
And he says with a sort of moan,
Its the cursed cold, and its got right hold
Till Im chilled clean through to the bone.
Yet taint being dead, its my awful dread
Of the icy grave that pains,
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair,
Youll cremate my last remains.

A pals last need is a thing to heed,
And I swore that I would not fail.
We started on at the streak of dawn,
But, God, he looked ghastly pale.
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day
Of his home in Tennessee,
And before nightfall, a corpse was all
That was left of Sam McGee.

There wasnt a breath in that land of death
As I hurried, horror driven,
With a corpse half hid that I couldnt get rid
Because of a promise given.
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say,
You may tax your brawn and brains,
But you promised true, and its up to you
To cremate those last remains.

Now, a promise made is a debt unpaid,
And the trail has its own stern code.
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb,
In my heart, how I cursed the load.
In the long, long night by the lone firelight
While the huskies round in a ring
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows
Oh, God, how I loathed the thing.

And every day that quiet clay
Seemed to heavy and heavier grow.
And on I went, though the dogs were spent
And the grub was getting low.
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad,
But I swore I would not give in,
And often Id sing to the hateful thing,
And it hearkened with a grin.

Till I came to the marge of Lake LaBarge,
And a derelict there lay.
It was jammed in the ice, and I saw in a trice
It was called the Alice May.
I looked at it, and I thought a bit,
And I looked at my frozen chum,
Then, Here, said I, with a sudden cry,
Is my crematorium.

Some planks I tore from the cabin floor
And lit the boiler fire.
Some coal I found that was lying around
And heaped the fuel higher.
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared,
Such a blaze you seldom see.
Then I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal
And I stuffed in Sam McGee.

Then I made a hike, for I didnt like
To hear him sizzle so.
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled,
And the wind began to blow.
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled
Down my cheek, and I dont know why,
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak
Went streaking down the sky.

I do not know how long in the snow
I wrestled with gristly fear.
But the stars came out, and they danced about
Ere again I ventured near.
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said,
Ill just take a peek inside.
I guess hes cooked, and its time I looked,
And the door I opened wide.

And there sat Sam, looking calm and cool
In the heart of the furnace roar.
He wore a smile you could see a mile,
And he said, Please close that door.
Its fine in here, but I greatly fear
Youll let in the cold and storm.
Since I left Plumbtree down in Tennessee
Its the first time Ive been warm.

There are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who moil for gold,
And the arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold.
The northern lights have seen queer sights,
But the queerest they ever did see
Was the night on the marge of Lake LaBarge
I cremated Sam McGee.
