1.1 OpenCore Plus Evaluation License: If YOU have acquired this MegaCore Function through OpenCore Plus Evaluation Program, YOUR license is limited. Under the OpenCore Plus Evaluation Program, SLS grants to YOU a single concurrent user, non-transferable, non-exclusive limited license to: (a) engage in software evaluation by performing design entry, timing, place and route, compilation, and verification of logic designs for Altera Devices for evaluation purposes only, provided that that YOU must acquire from SLS a license that specifically permits the programming of Altera Devices for production use prior to doing so, and (b) engage in hardware evaluation by programming the MegaCore Function into Altera Devices so long as the Altera Device is continuously connected via a programming cable to a host development computer which is running Altera development tool programmer software, or otherwise the MegaCore Function will operate for a predetermined amount of time, after which the MegaCore Function is automatically disabled and inoperable. YOU are expressly prohibited from using any MegaCore Function to program Non-Altera Devices. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE MEGACORE FUNCTION MAY BE FUNCTION-, TIME- OR CLOCK-CYCLE LIMITED AND THUS, WITHOUT LIMITING THE EFFECT OF PARAGRAPH 7.2, IN NO EVENT WILL SLS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY RESULTING FROM THE AUTOMATIC DISABLING OF ANY MEGACORE FUNCTIONS OBTAINED THROUGH THE OPENCORE PLUS EVALUATION PROGRAM.

1.2 YOU may make only one copy of the MegaCore Function for back-up purposes only. The MegaCore Function may not be copied to, installed on or used with any other computer without prior written approval from SLS.

1.3 Any copies of the MegaCore Function made by or for YOU shall include all intellectual property notices, including copyright and proprietary rights notices, appearing on such MegaCore Function. Any copy or portion of the MegaCore Function, including any portion merged into a design and any design or product that incorporates any portion of the MegaCore Function, will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.


2. MegaCore License Restrictions :
YOU MAY NOT USE THE MEGACORE FUNCTION EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT OR SUBLICENSE OR TRANSFER THE MEGACORE FUNCTION OR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT THERETO. YOU MAY NOT DECOMPILE, DISASSEMBLE, OR OTHERWISE REVERSE ENGINEER THE MEGACORE FUNCTION OR ATTEMPT TO ACCESS OR DERIVE THE SOURCE CODE OF THE MEGACORE FUNCTION OR ANY ALGORITHMS, CONCEPTS, TECHNIQUES, METHODS OR PROCESSES EMBODIED THEREIN; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN A MEMBER NATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PERMITS LIMITED REVERSE ENGINEERING NOTWITHSTANDING A CONTRACTUAL PROHIBITION TO THE CONTRARY, YOU MAY PERFORM LIMITED REVERSE ENGINEERING, BUT ONLY AFTER GIVING NOTICE TO SLS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE APPLICABLE LAW IMPLEMENTING THE EU SOFTWARE DIRECTIVE OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW NOTWITHSTANDING A CONTRACTUAL PROHIBITION TO THE CONTRARY.
