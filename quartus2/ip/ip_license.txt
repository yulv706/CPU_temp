10.1 The provisions of Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 shall 
survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 
10.2 Licensee may not assign its rights or obligations under 
this Agreement without the prior written consent of Altera, and 
any purported assignment without such consent shall have no

its entire business, Licensee shall obtain Altera' prior written 
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to 
the benefit of the respective parties hereto and their 
successors and assigns. In the event of an assignment or 
attempted assignment by Licensee without Altera' prior written 
approval, this Agreement shall immediately terminate. 
10.3 All intellectual property rights pertaining to the Licensed 
Software and Documentation, and all ownership rights in and to

("C.F.R."). If the Licensed Software is acquired for use by the 
U.S. Government, then pursuant to 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
227.7202 as applicable, the U.S. Government end users acquire 
only the sublicensed rights set forth in Section 2 herein and 
their use, duplication and disclosure of the Licensed Software 
is subject to the restrictions of this Agreement. The Licensed 
Software is also a "commercial item" as that term is defined in 
48 C.F.R. 52.244. 
10.8 Licensee acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement may 
cause irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages 
would be inadequate, and that, in addition to any and all 
remedies available at law and equity, Altera shall be entitled 
to seek injunctive relief to protect its rights under this 
Agreement. 
10.9 In the event any proceeding or lawsuit is brought by either 
Party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing Party in

costs for such action, including its reasonable attorneys' fees, 
expert witness fees.

does not confer any rights to use any of the other Party's 
names, trademarks, or logos for any reason, including but not 
limited to, in connection with it advertising, publicity or 
other marketing activities. 
10.11 No failure or delay by either Party to enforce or take 
advantage of any provision or right under this Agreement shall 
constitute a subsequent waiver of that provision or right, nor 
shall it be deemed to be a waiver of any of the other terms and 
conditions of this Agreement.
10.12 This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California, without 
regard to provisions concerning conflicts of law. The United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.

States and foreign laws in performing under this Agreement.

the home country of the Party, postage prepaid, by certified, 
registered or first class mail, addressed to the Parties at 
their addresses set forth above.
10.15 In the event that any provision of this Agreement is 
prohibited by any law governing its construction, performance or 
enforcement, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent 
of such prohibition without invalidating thereby any of the 
remaining provisions of the Agreement.
10.16 This Agreement may be executed in one or more 
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all 
of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 
10.17 This Agreement, including its Appendices, sets forth the 
entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject 
matter herein, and supersedes and replaces all prior or 
contemporaneous agreements, discussions and understandings, 
written or oral, with respect to such subject matter. The terms 
and conditions of this Agreement may not be modified, or amended

and is signed by an authorized representative of each Party 
hereto.

The GNU General Public License 
(GPL)
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to 
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program 
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation 
software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You 
can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you 
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you 
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that 
you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to 
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We 
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such 
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing 
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included 
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as 
"you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program 
is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been 
made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part 
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties 
under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use 
in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including 
an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty 
(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user 
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself 
is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your 
work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with 
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of 
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable 
copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the 
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all 
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to 
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of 
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly 
or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the 
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" 
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James 
Hacker.

Ty Coon, President of Vice
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public 
License instead of this License.

The following license agreement applies only to the Eclipse 
3.2.1, Eclipse 3.3.1, Eclipse CDT 3.1.1, Eclipse CDT 4.0.2, and 
Jaxb 2 portions of the Nios II EDS software:
Eclipse Public License -v 1.0
(plain text) 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 
ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE 
OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means: 
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code 
and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and  
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:  
i) changes to the Program, and  
ii) additions to the Program; 
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate 
from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A 
Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to 
the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such 
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software 
distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own 
license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the 
Program. 
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the 
Program. 
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a 
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale 
of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with 
this Agreement. 
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this 
Agreement, including all Contributors. 
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, 
royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source 
code and object code form.  
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor 
hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, 
royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, 
use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the 
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code 
and object code form. This patent license shall apply to 
the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such 
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall 
not apply to any other combinations which include the 
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.  
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor 
grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, 
no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the 
Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual 
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor 
disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising 
the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient 
hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other 
intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, 
if a third party patent license is required to allow 
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's 
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing 
the Program.  
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has 
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to 
grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in 
object code form under its own license agreement, provided 
that: 
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement; and  
b) its license agreement:  
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors 
all warranties and conditions, express and implied, 
including warranties or conditions of title and non-
infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of 
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;  
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors 
all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, 
special, incidental and consequential damages, such as 
lost profits;  
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this 
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and 
not by any other party; and  
iv) states that source code for the Program is 
available from such Contributor, and informs licensees 
how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through 
a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
When the Program is made available in source code form: 
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and  
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each 
copy of the Program. 
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices 
contained within the Program. 
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of 
its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably 
allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of 
the Contribution. 
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
responsibilities with respect to end users, business 
partners and the like. While this license is intended to 
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the 
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial 
product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
create potential liability for other Contributors. 
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a 
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial 
Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every 
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any 
losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a 
third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the 
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the 
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations 
in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified 
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the 
Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related 
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may 
participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a 
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is 
then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial 
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers 
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims 
and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial 
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and 
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor 
to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
must pay those damages. 
5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE 
PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS 
OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible 
for determining the appropriateness of using and 
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated 
with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , 
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program 
errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss 
of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or 
interruption of operations. 
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER 
RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR 
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE 
OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY 
RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or 
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the 
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
this Agreement, and without further action by the parties 
hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
enforceable. 
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any 
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding 
combinations of the Program with other software or 
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate 
if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or 
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure 
in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such 
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this 
Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and 
distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably 
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this 
Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to 
the Program shall continue and survive. 
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this 
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the 
Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the 
following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right 
to publish new versions (including revisions) of this 
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the 
Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. 
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. 
The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to 
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate 
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the 
version of the Agreement under which it was received. In 
addition, after a new version of the Agreement is 
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program 
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except 
as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, 
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the 
intellectual property of any Contributor under this 
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted 
under this Agreement are reserved. 
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New 
York and the intellectual property laws of the United 
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a 
legal action under this Agreement more than one year after 
the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to 
a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written 
permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
